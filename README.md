# LED Blink Example

This repository contains a simple Arduino sketch for beginners.

## Wiring

Connect an LED (with a resistor) between pin 13 and ground on your Arduino.

## Uploading

Open `Part1_LED/Part1_LED.ino` in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your board.

## Customizing the Blink Rate

Change the value of `blinkDelayMs` at the top of the sketch to adjust how long the LED stays on or off.
